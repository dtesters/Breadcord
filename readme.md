Build yourself or get prebuilt from https://github.com/EricPanDev/Breadcord/releases

Anyways to build yourself:
1. install nodejs
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run package-win` or `npm run package-macos`
the app will be in the dist/ folder

test without build:
1. install nodejs
2. `npm install`
3. run `npm.cmd start`
